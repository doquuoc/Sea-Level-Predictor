# Sea-Level-Predictor
Sea Level Pridictor
Mean sea level (MSL, often shortened to sea level) is an average surface level of one or more among Earth's coastal bodies of water from which heights such as elevation may be measured.
In this project, we will analyze a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880, and use the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050.
